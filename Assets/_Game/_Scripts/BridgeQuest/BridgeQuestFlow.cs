    ///    a card is still moving.

    ///    on unscaled time. Each card caches and restores the previous timescale
    ///    rather than assuming 1, so nested cards cannot strand the clock at zero.
    ///  - Replay is an in-place reset, never a scene reload, so the storyboard and
    ///    the tutorial do not replay.
